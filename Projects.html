            HTML, CSS, JavaScript
        </p>
        <p>
            I made this tracker to learn javascript and figure out how it works with HTML and CSS.
            It is an interactive checklist that helps players to stay organized, and saves their selections using local storage.
            It loads data from a JSON file that is grouped into categories. It also has progress bars that track progress by percentage for both category and overall completion.
            I wanted to make something meaningful, and this is something that I will actually use when I play!

        My Website
        <p>
            I made this website to have a place to display my projects and all my information. I used it to teach myself HTML, CSS, and website design in general.
            My college classes have not taught this, but I wanted to learn it so I did it myself.
            I am very proud of the website so far, and I plan to add more to it over time.
